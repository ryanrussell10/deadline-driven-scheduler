# deadline-driven-scheduler
This report describes the design and implementation of a deadline driven scheduler, written in C using FreeRTOS, that uses the earliest deadline first (EDF) algorithm for task scheduling. This deadline driven scheduler has been built on top of the existing FreeRTOS task scheduler. Therefore, both deadline-driven tasks (DD-Tasks) and FreeRTOS tasks (F-Tasks) are present in the system.
